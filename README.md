## ✅ Requirements

### Unity
- **Unity Version:** `2022.3.62f2 (LTS)`  
  Use this exact version whenever possible to avoid serialization or package compatibility issues.

### Android Build Support (required)
In **Unity Hub → Installs → (your Unity version) → Add modules**, ensure these are installed:
- Android Build Support
- Android SDK & NDK Tools
- OpenJDK

### XR SDK
- **XR SDK:** **PICO Integration `3.0.5`** (local package)
- This project uses a **local package** stored under:
  - `Packages/PICO_Integration_3.0.5/...`
- If Unity reports that the PICO package is missing, check:
  - `Packages/manifest.json` points to the local package using a **relative `file:` path**.

## 📦 Missing Assets / Not Included in This Repository

Some files are excluded intentionally (for repo size, reproducibility, and security):

### 1) Large binary assets
Examples:
- Large 3D models (e.g., `*.glb`)
- Large videos (`*.mp4`, `*.mov`)
- Large textures/audio files

**If a scene requires a missing large model**, you must provide the asset yourself and place it into the correct `Assets/` folder path (keeping the original folder structure).

### 2) Generated Unity files (regeneratable)
Examples:
- Baked lighting outputs such as `LightingData.asset`

These are generated by Unity and may differ across machines. They are not required in version control.

### 3) Build artifacts (not versioned)
Examples:
- `*.apk`, `*.aab`

### 4) Sensitive signing materials (never commit)
Examples:
- `*.keystore`, `*.jks`

> ⚠️ **Signing keys and passwords are NOT included in this repository.**  
> For release builds, you must create and configure your own keystore.

## ⚙️ Project Settings (Important / Crash-Prone)

Changing these settings may cause **black screen**, **startup crash**, or **installation failure** on Android VR devices.

### 1) Graphics API

Unity: **Edit → Project Settings → Player → Android → Other Settings**

* Keep **OpenGLES3** enabled.
* Avoid removing OpenGLES3 unless you have fully validated Vulkan on your target device.

### 2) Scripting Backend & CPU Architectures

Unity: **Player → Android → Other Settings**

* **Scripting Backend:** **IL2CPP**
* **Target Architectures:** enable **ARM64**

  * Disabling ARM64 can cause runtime failure on modern XR devices.

### 3) Android API Levels

Unity: **Player → Android → Other Settings**

* **Minimum API Level:** **Android 10.0 (API 29)** or higher (recommended for XR)
* **Target API Level:** **Automatic (highest installed)** is acceptable
